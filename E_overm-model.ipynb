    "A hole in the center of the plate allows the charges to continue through in a region in which a magnetic field acts perpendicular to the path of the moving charges.  The path is bent into a semi-circlular path by the magnetic field, and the charges hit the plate a certain distance out from the center of the plate, where their enegery creates a bright spot upon their landing on a fluorescent ring painted on the plate.\n",
